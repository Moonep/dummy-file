This adventure starts out with the creation of the universe, along with it two sides were created. The good (the santas), the bad (the ERGO).
The first santa to be created was named Fanta. 
Fanta among other things was an intelligent being that radiated light.
Along the duality of this pure being is the ERGO.
A mass of pure hatred that swarmed areas to the likes of cicadas.
Though in the bleakest hours of this universe, Fanta was always there to save the day from this foul being.
Many, Many, eons later the earth was created out of an improbability.
With this improbability shockwaves were sent throughout the universe.
With this, Fanta built up a keen interest to the planet.
But he wasn't the only one who felt the creation of this planet.
